# Zero-Knowledge Authentication Platform
## Breakthrough Security By Privacy-First Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

Cypher is a revolutionary shift in digital authentication, unifying the most advanced cryptographic protocols to deliver unprecedented security without the cost of user privacy. By using OPAQUE for oblivious authentication, the new rotating PASETO tokens, and TOTP 2FA, we've created a genuinely breakthrough zero-trust authentication system.

In an era of rising data breaches and privacy legislation, our answer eliminates the original flaw: cached passwords. We don't protect passwordsâ€”we make them unknowable, even to us.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current Authentication Landscape
- **Password Vulnerabilities**: Data breaches consistently feature hacked credentials
- **Centralized Risk**: Traditional systems offer honeypots of authentication-sensitive data
- **Privacy Violations**: Current solutions require that you trust service providers to keep user credentials safe
- **Compliance Complexity**: Companies struggle with evolving privacy legislation around the world

### Market Pain Points
- Enterprise security teams face increasing regulatory weight
- Users want to have privacy without sacrificing ease of use
- Organizations need audit trails without compromising sensitive data
- Legacy infrastructure is responsible for causing integration challenges to newer security requirements
- **Literally life-ending breach aftermath**: Equifax exposed 147M Americans to identity theft and financial ruin; Anthem health care breach revealed 80M patient records including medical history and SSNs; T-Mobile's repeated data breaches exposed customer financial information enabling targeted fraud which literally destroyed families
- **Career-ending accountability**: Executives individually charged with crimes for data security failures - GDPR makes executives individually accountable, not corporations
- **Existential business risk**: Target lost $290M and their CEO after their breach; Yahoo lost $350M of acquisition value from unseen breaches
