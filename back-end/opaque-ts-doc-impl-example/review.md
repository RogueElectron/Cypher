Constructor and Initialization
The OpaqueServer constructor requires specific parameters and type conversions. opaque_server.ts:48-69 The constructor expects:

A Config object
An oprf_seed as number[]
An ake_keypair_export as AKEExportKeyPair
An optional server_identity string
Type Definitions and Interfaces
The AKEExportKeyPair interface defines the required structure for server keypairs. thecrypto.ts:158-161 Both private_key and public_key must be number[] arrays, not Uint8Array.

Hex Conversion Utilities
For converting hex-encoded environment variables, use the utility functions available in the test helpers. common.ts:52-58 The fromHex() function converts hex strings to Uint8Array, and toHex() converts back to hex strings.

Configuration Setup
Create an OPAQUE configuration using the available suite IDs. suites.ts:21-62 The OpaqueConfig class provides pre-configured setups for different curve/hash combinations.

Registration Methods
The server implements the RegistrationServer interface with the registerInit method. opaque_server.ts:71-80 This method handles the server-side registration initialization.

Authentication Methods
The server implements the AuthServer interface with authInit and authFinish methods. opaque_server.ts:82-117 These handle the two phases of the authentication protocol.

Serialization and Deserialization
All message types have built-in serialization support. messages.ts:10-59 The Serializable abstract class provides the foundation, and specific message classes like RegistrationRequest, RegistrationResponse, and RegistrationRecord have serialize() and deserialize() static methods.

Full Protocol Example
The test suite demonstrates the complete registration and authentication flow. opaque_full.test.ts:62-67 opaque_full.test.ts:131-136 This shows how to instantiate the server and use it in both registration and authentication scenarios.

Key Implementation Points
Environment Variable Handling: Convert hex strings from environment variables to number[] arrays by first using fromHex() to get Uint8Array, then converting to Array.from().

Type Conversion: The AKEExportKeyPair requires number[] arrays, while internal operations use Uint8Array. opaque_server.ts:58-61

Error Handling: All methods can return Error objects, so proper error checking is essential. common.ts:68-70

Storage Interface: Implement a storage mechanism for user records, similar to the test KVStorage class. common.ts:6-46

Notes
The LocalOpaqueServer should wrap the OpaqueServer instance and provide higher-level methods that handle the hex conversion, serialization/deserialization, and storage operations. The underlying OPAQUE protocol requires careful handling of the multi-step registration and authentication flows, with proper serialization between client and server messages. Environment variables should be validated and converted from hex format to the appropriate number[] format required by the library's interfaces.
